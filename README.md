# Hello!

My name is Nickolay "kolya5544" Kushnarenko. I am a C# backend developer and a DevOps server engineer who is also interested in cybersecurity.

My routine includes developing server and desktop applications that primarily utilize .NET Core and Python. I also know a bit of Java, JavaScript and TypeScript, Solidity, and several other backend languages on a basic level.

I host numerous services and fancy websites:
- [My personal webpage](https://nk.ax/)
- [CodeGuru, a VK bot that allows you to run your code, process pictures, and so on](https://vk.com/ccguru)
- [CryptoAlarm, a Telegram bot that reports liquidations, presents you with trading opportunities, and more!](https://t.me/cryptoalr)
- My own private image, file, and text sharing platform. Select file or photo -> Ctrl+PrintScreen -> get public link to resource

I also actively contribute to different open-source projects, especially Bybit-related ones. Some of them include:
- [pybit](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit) as a maintainer
- [Bybit API Documentation](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/docs)

And I am an official developer of these wonderful products:
- [bybit_p2p](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/bybit_p2p) - Official Bybit P2P API integration library written in Python.
- [Bybit.P2P](https://github.com/kolya5544/Bybit.P2P) - An unofficial Bybit P2P API integration SDK written in C#.
