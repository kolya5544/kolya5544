# Hello!

I am Nickolay "kolya5544" Kushnarenko. I am a C# backend developer.

I develop server applications as well as desktop programs that primarily utilize .NET Core or .NET Framework. I also know a bit of Java, Python, JavaScript and TypeScript, Solidity.

I host numerous services and fancy websites:
- [My personal webpage](https://nk.ax/)
- [CodeGuru, a VK bot that allows you to run your code, process pictures, and so on](https://vk.com/ccguru)
- [My own private pastebin](https://paste.nk.ax/)
- [My own private image, file, and text sharing platform. Select file or photo -> Ctrl+PrintScreen -> get public link to resource](https://panel.nk.ax/fs/)
- [My personal blog: Kolya's Kunstkammer. Yes, it's not very active.](https://blog.nk.ax/)
- [CryptoAlarm, a Telegram bot that reports liquidations, presents you with trading opportunities, and more!](https://t.me/cryptoalr)

I also actively contribute to different open-source projects, especially Bybit-related ones. Some of them include:
- [pybit](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit)
- [Bybit API Documentation](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/docs)

And I am an official developer of these wonderful products:
- [bybit_p2p](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/bybit_p2p) - Official Bybit P2P API integration library written in Python.
- [Bybit.P2P](https://github.com/kolya5544/Bybit.P2P) - An unofficial Bybit P2P API integration SDK written in C#.
